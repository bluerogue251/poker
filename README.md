# Poker Hand Ranker

This is my attempt to implement a Poker Hand Ranker as described in Peer to Peer with Camille Baldock.

I am writing it before I've seen the full video, so that later I can compare and contrast with what Camille comes up with.

The problem prompt is:

> A "hand" in poker consists of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck. Implement a system which can decide which of two hands has the highest ranking, according to the standard poker ranking rules.
