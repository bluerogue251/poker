# Poker Hand Ranker

This is my implementation of a Poker Hand Ranker as in the [Peer to Peer screencast with Camille Baldock][peer_to_peer]. I am writing it before I've seen the full video so I can compare and contrast with what Camille comes up with.

The prompt is:

> A "hand" in poker consists of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck. Implement a system which can decide which of two hands has the highest ranking, according to the standard poker ranking rules.
